<h1 style="color:white;">Artist Statement</h1>

<p style="color:black;">I like to use art as a way to express my inner emotions and to show my creativity. I would like to produce artwork based on the famous places I have traveled to, things I have seen in the real world and fictional characters. In the future, I would like to use digital art to produce art pieces depicting sci fi, magical, fantasy lands because I enjoy being creative and using my imagination to producing something beautiful. As I watched many different animations, I became inspired by the one and only Walt Disney. He inspired me to believe that if I work hard enough, my dreams can come true. Also, he inspires me to just be myself and that I can use my imagination to bring my artwork to life and share it with others to make them happy. That's what he wanted to do. He wanted to make people happy. Now, Walt Disney has inspired me to do the same thing: be an artist for Disney and work to make people happy.</p>
